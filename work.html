      <div class="piece-body">
        <p>A trademark of large national news organizations has been the expansive, high-end digital presentations of important and impactful stories &mdash; like these pieces from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/hostage/" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href="https://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/machines" target="_blank">NPR</a>, to name a few.</p>

        <p>GateHouse Media (now Gannett), with well more than 100 dailies, had a gap. The large newsrooms &mdash; The Columbus Dispatch, Austin American-Statesman, Daytona Beach News-Journal &mdash; had dedicated digital staff who could build large enterprise projects for important stories. What about the newsrooms without thise resoources, the ones with 10, five, even one person on staff?</p>

        <p>In 2017, before I joined the team, de//space set out to fill this gap with an easy-to-use, off-platform storytelling solution that let journalists give heightened design to their story and work beyond the often-limiting CMS. Architect was born.</p>

        <p>Based in WordPress, sites are built at a separate, national-level multisite. Using this national domain to host these sites allows for easy syndication across the network, and with some JSON magic, local papers retain their brand's logo and tracking with each site they build (examples of how that works here).</p>

        <p>In early 2019, the team looked to refresh the aesthetics of Architect and move the theme into the new WordPress 5.0 Gutenberg editor. My job was to assess the pain points our current users had with the first version and address those in the new theme.</p>

        <p>First, we assessed when and how Architect should be used.</p>

        <div class="piece-body-image">
          <img src="assets/arch-graph.jpg" alt="ASketched graph showing the four types of stories: CMS stories, Architect stories, Architect-plus stories, and hand builds.">
        </div>

        <p>We classified stories based on a scale of high imapct to normal impact and visual to not visual. If the stroy doesn't have strong visuals and is of normal impact (i.e., a traffic accident blocks a lane on the freeway), it should be published through the CMS.</p>

        <p>Stories that have the highest amount of impact, often so important the piece received input from national editors, would often be considered "hand builds," where dedicated digital teams could build special projects with databases and interactives.</p>

        <p>But between these two categories existed the gap; some stories were too important or visual to be left to the normal article templet, but weren't quite of national importance or needed a quick turnaround time for the local news cycle. Here is where Architect builds sit.</p>

        <p>Even further, editors at the newsroom level often look to push the story further than the out-of-the-box components that come with the theme for especially important projects. These builds are called Arch+, where the de//space team assists the local newsroom in adding custom-build graphics, dynamic intros and other components that require extra attention.</p>

        <p>The new theme needed to work great out of the box for local newsrooms but be easy to customize or enhance if an Arch+ build was needed.</p>

        <p>Next, I intereviewed several users of the first verion, ranging from a digital producer &mdash; who build more than a dozen projects in the original theme and added her own styling on top of it &mdash; to a reporter from a small newsroom who only used the components as they came. I developed a few user personas to identify the needs across our newsrooms of various sizes and journalists of various skill.</p>

        <div class="piece-body-image">
          <img src="assets/journeys.png" alt="Journey map for one user persona.">
        </div>

        <p>From these personas, I finalized the list of components needed to make buidling a site in Architect as easy as possible. I also expanded on the components from the previous verions by offering variations of popular layout items (i.e., multiple images inline, toggleable image captions, etc). The next few months were dedicated to development.</p>
